          The major power of the House is to pass federal legislation that
          affects the entire country, although its bills must also be passed by
          the Senate and further agreed to by the U.S. President before becoming
          law (unless both the House and Senate re-pass the legislation with a
          two-thirds majority in each chamber). The House has some exclusive
          powers: the power to initiate revenue bills, to impeach officials
          (impeached officials are subsequently tried in the Senate), and to
          elect the U.S. President in case there is no majority in the Electoral
          College. Each U.S. state is represented in the House in proportion to
          its population as measured in the census, but every state is entitled
          to at least one representative.
