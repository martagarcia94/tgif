        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="fs-5 col-12">
          Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency.
          In a free society, transparency is government's obligation to share
          information with citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens hold
          their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that
          government should be transparent. Governments exist to serve the
          people. Information on how officials conduct the public business and
          spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood.
          This transparency allows good and just governance. Transparency
          promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about
          what their Government is doing. We also believe that government should
          be participatory. Public engagement enhances the Government's
          effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is
          widely dispersed in society, and public officials benefit from having
          access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to
          become actively engaged in American government. TGIF works to disclose
          information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We
          solicit public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the
          public.

        <h2>Background History of Government Transparency</h2>
        <p class="fs-5 col-12">
          In the West, the idea that government should be open to public
          scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion dates back at least to the
          time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on
          absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their
          intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative instruments to
          this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example,
          (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting
          free press legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of the
          Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes more
          broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on the
          eighteenth-century public sphere. Influenced by Enlightenment thought,
          the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789), freedom of the
          press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary
          accounting and freedom of the press in constitutional articles. In the
          nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on
          these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal
          politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the
          latter. Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of
          contemporary democratic practice and is often linked to the passing of
          freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to
          have adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the
          origins of its modern provisions to the eighteenth century and Finland
          continuing the presumption of openness after gaining independence in
          1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951
          (superseded by new legislation in 1999). The United States passed its
          Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to
          Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and
          Norway in 1970.
